    <p>
        A decurion was a Roman cavalry officer in command of a squadron (turma) of cavalrymen in the Roman army.

    <p>
        During the Roman Republic a "Polybian" legion (c. 300–88 BC) of citizen-levies had a cavalry complement of 300 horse, divided into 10 turmae (squadrons) of 30 men each. Each turma was led by three decurions, who were elected by the squadron members themselves. Although decurio literally means "leader of ten men", it does not appear that a turma was sub-divided into three troops of ten men each. Instead, one decurion would act as squadron commander and the other two as his deputies.

        In the imperial Roman army of the Principate (30 BC – AD 284), a decurion also commanded a cavalry turma of c. 30 men, but now without colleagues. In common with all soldiers in the imperial army, decurions were long-service professionals, the majority volunteers.

        A Roman imperial legion, which contained c. 5,600 men, contained a small cavalry arm of just 120 men (i.e., four turmae). Since the average number of legions deployed was c. 30, imperial legionary cavalry numbered only c. 3,600, out of a total of c. 80,000 cavalrymen deployed by the imperial army. There were thus c. 120 cavalry decurions in the legions at any given time.
